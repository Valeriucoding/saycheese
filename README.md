# ðŸ§€ Romanian Types of Cheese ðŸ§€

This project is made for [saycheese.hackclub.com](https://saycheese.hackclub.com/). The challenge is to create an app or website where the entire source code can fit into a QR code.

## Project Overview

I chose to create a website dedicated to traditional Romanian types of cheese. The goal was to provide information about various cheeses, their origins, and unique characteristics.

## QR Code Generation

To fit the entire source code into a QR code, I utilized the tool available at [sandwich.a-burger.xyz](https://sandwich.a-burger.xyz/). It was a fun challenge to determine what to remove and what to keep in order to meet the size constraints.

## Getting Started

To view the project, scan the QR code below:

**Note:** Use a QR code app to scan it, and if the website doesn't load, try copying the text from the QR code and pasting it into a browser.
